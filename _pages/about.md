I am now a Lecturer at [Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture (BUCEA)](https://www.bucea.edu.cn/). Prior to joining BUCEA, I was a Post-doc in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof.Zhe Wang](https://walterzwang.github.io). I received my Ph.D. in Faculty of Architecture, Civil And Transportation Engineering at Beijing University of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://facte.bjut.edu.cn/info/1087/1673.htm) and [Prof. Xiufeng Pang](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%80%84%E7%A7%80%E9%94%8B/22228377?fr=aladdin), in 2021. I received my B.Eng. degree in College of Architecture and Civil Engineering at Beijing University of Technology in 2015.

My current research interests lie in building energy system control and flexible energy use in buildings. My broad research interests focus on building retrofitting and energy simulation. I have published over 30 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O9GHtT8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FDanWang9264%2Fdanwang9264.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international SCI journal such as _Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews_, _Applied Energy_, _Journal of Energy Storage_, etc.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
